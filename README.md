This C# program calculates and displays details of a product, including its ID, inventory count, total items sold, product price, and total revenue.

- **`short`** for Product ID: Stores the product's unique identifier.
- **`int`** for Inventory Count: Stores the number of products in stock.
- **`long`** for Total Items Sold: Stores large numbers for total items sold.
- **`float`** for Product Price: Stores the product's price with decimal precision.
- **`double`** for Total Revenue: Calculates and stores the total revenue from product sales.

The program outputs the product's details and its total revenue based on the sales and price.

Hereâ€™s a shorter explanation for each data type:

1. **`short` for Product ID**: Efficient for small integers (2 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767).
2. **`int` for Inventory Count**: Suitable for whole numbers up to 2 billion (4 bytes).
3. **`long` for Total Items Sold**: Needed for large numbers (8 bytes, up to 9 quintillion).
4. **`float` for Product Price**: Used for decimal values with moderate precision (4 bytes).
5. **`double` for Total Revenue**: Provides higher precision for financial calculations (8 bytes).
